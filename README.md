# PermTestingToolbox
CPU and GPU implementations of Permutation Testing using the libraries Armadillo and Arrayfire

## Setup

### OSX

Download homebrew

### Ubuntu 

Download the C++ linear algebra library, Armadillo. Do NOT use `apt-get` to install Armadillo, this will install a very old version (4.2). This software has been tested against Armadillo 5.*, 6.1 and 6.2. So go to http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html download the latest stable version and follow the `README.txt` instruction on how to install Armadillo. It is VERY important that you install all the requirements (section 3 of the `README.txt`) before you proceed to build and install Armadillo (section 4 of the `README.txt`).
