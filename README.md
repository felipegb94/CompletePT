# PermTestingToolbox
CPU and GPU implementations of Permutation Testing using the libraries Armadillo and Arrayfire. The permutation testing schemes implemented herein are based on two-sample and one-sample t-test. 

## Setup 

### OSX

Download homebrew

### Ubuntu 

Download the C++ linear algebra library, Armadillo. Do NOT use `apt-get` to install Armadillo, this will install a very old version (4.2). This software has been tested against Armadillo 5.*, 6.1 and 6.2. So go to http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html download the latest stable version and follow the `README.txt` instruction on how to install Armadillo. It is VERY important that you install all the requirements (section 3 of the `README.txt`) before you proceed to build and install Armadillo (section 4 of the `README.txt`).

## Background Notes
### General Linear Model
GLM models observed data (dependent variable) as a linear combination
of predictor variables (independent variables, covariates etc). `Y (observed data matrix), X (design matrix, predictor variables), b (parameter estimate vector), and e (error vector).`

```
Y = X * b + e
```

Many statistical techniques are special cases of the general linear model. For example:

* ANOVA asks whether different experimental conditions (X1, X2, etc)
are associated with different scores.

* Multiple regression asks whether scores are related to predictor
variables (X1, X2, etc) 

* T-test is a special case of ANOVA where there are only two groups X1 and X2

The three of them are asking the same question. Is there a relationship between  a dependent variable (Yi) and one or more independent variables (Xi).

### T-tests

__1. Paired Sample t-test:__ Used to compare two population means in the case of two samples that are correlated. Commonly used in 'before and after' studies, case-control studies.The typical workflow for two-sample t-test hypothesis testing is:

__2. One-Sample t-test:__ The one sample t test is an appropriate analysis when the research looks to compare the mean of a sample with a hypothesized mean to assess if differences occur. The assumptions of the one sample t test include: the data must be normally distributed within the population and the data should be independent; scores of one participant are not dependent upon scores of another.

__3. Two-Sample t-test:__ Used to determine if two population means are equal.

### Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a group of techniques in Statistics that are often used in medical images to identify regions that display statistical significant activity. So how do we classify a voxel as statistically significant?

  *1. Select univariate test-statistic:* The job of this test statistic is to act as the mapping from data to a detection threshold.
   
  *2. Hypothesis setup:* Setup two hypothesis. The null hypothesis (H0) says that there is no mean difference between both samples. The alternate hypothesis says that they are different.   
  
  *3. Select Significance Level:* Choose the significance level. Usually 5% in most studies and 1% in medical studies. This is usually denoted as alpha, and it tells us the probability of making a Type I error; that is the probability of deciding erroneously on the alternative when, in fact, the null hypothesis is true.   
  
  *4. Calculate the Parameter:* To calculate the parameter using the fo 
  
  *5. Testing of hypothesis:* Compare result to table value.
